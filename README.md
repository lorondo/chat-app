# Chat App

## Objective

To build a chat app for mobile devices using **React Native**. The app will provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their location.

## Context

As mobile phones become increasingly central to daily tasks like shopping, communication, and scheduling, many companies are opting for native mobile apps instead of web apps. Building separate apps for iOS and Android traditionally required maintaining multiple codebases. However, with technologies like **React Native**, companies can now develop both Android and iOS apps with a single codebase.

For this project, you'll use **React Native**, **Expo**, and **Google Firestore Database** to build a chat app, showcasing your skills in **JavaScript mobile development** with a focus on cross-platform app development.

## Features

- **Chat Interface**: Allows users to send and receive messages in real-time.
- **Image Sharing**: Users can share images during a conversation.
- **Location Sharing**: Users can share their current location with others.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework for building mobile apps for iOS and Android.
- **Expo**: Platform for building and deploying React Native apps.
- **Google Firestore Database**: A NoSQL cloud database for storing and syncing data in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lorondo/chat-app.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd chat-app
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the app:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4. For Android or iOS emulators, you can run:
    ```bash
    npm run android
    npm run ios
    ```

## Acknowledgments

- React Native and Expo for providing the tools to build cross-platform apps.
- Firebase for real-time database integration.
